## Cloning / Initializing a Repository

#### Initializing

1. `$ git init`  
   Turn current directory into a Git repository
2. `$ git add .`  
   Add current directory (and all its subdirectories) to staging area
3. `$ git commit -m "Initial commit"`  
   Commit files in staging area with included message
4. Create a repository (on Github)
5. `$ git remote add origin [url copied from Github]`  
   Create a new remote named origin located at url (Origin can be replaced with any name)
   _Push/Pull commands can be used with origin now instead of typing out the url_
6. `$ git push -u origin master`  
   Push changes to remote repository

#### Cloning

1. Create a repository (on Github)
2. `$ git clone [url copied from Github]`

<br>

## Commonly Used Commands

- `$ git add .` / `$ git add [file1] [file2]`

  _Types of add [here](#Git-add-Types)_
- `$ git commit` / `$ git commit -m "message"`  
  Commit files in staging area with message  
  If `-m` is ommited, will be brought to [default git editor (nano/vim)](#Using-git-editornanovim-when-committing-without--m) to enter multi-line commmit message, a format of `$ git commit -m "Head message" -m "Description"` can also be used instead
- `$ git commit -am "message"`  
  Add and commit all modified files with message in one command  
  _Does not add any untracked files_
- `$ git pull` / `$ git pull origin master`  
  Pull changes from current working branch or master branch of remote 'origin'  
  _`$ git pull -u origin master` may be required for pulling for the first time to associate local branch with remote branch_
- `$ git push` / `$ git push origin master`  
  Push staged files to current working branch or master branch of remote 'origin'  
  _`$ git push -u origin master` may be required for pushing for the first time to associate local branch with remote branch_

#### Using git editor(nano/vim) when committing without -m

##### Nano

1. `Ctrl + X` (to prompt exit after entering commit message)
2. `Y` (to save changes)
3. `Enter` (to exit)

##### Vim

1. `1` (to enter commit message)

## Commonly Used Commands for Fixing Mistakes

- `$ git checkout` / `$ git checkout [file1] [file2]`

- `$ git commit --amend -m "Correct message"`  
  Replace the last commit (only commits that has not been pushed), including a corrected message if necessary  
  _If a file is added after a commit, using the above command will add the file along with the corrected commit message to replace the last commit. This is used if a file intended for a commit was not added_
- `$ git cherry-pick [hash of commit to copy]`  
  Copy a commit to the current branch  
  _Able to copy commits from other branches (hash of commit can be shown in `$ git log`)_

  _Types of resets [here](#Git-reset-Types)_
- `$ git clean -df`  
  Remove any untracked directories and files
- `$ git reflog`  
  Shows all commits in the order of last being referenced
- `$ git revert [hash of commit]`  
  Add a new commit resetting the commit with the hash entered  
  _This is only intended if the commit that needs resetting has already been pushed to the remote repository_

   Push changes (merged branch) to master branch of remote repository
10. `$ git branch -d [featureName]`  
    Delete branch in local repository
11. `$ git push origin --delete [featureName]`

2. `$ git checkout [hash of commit before reset(from reflog)]`  
   Go to the commit before deleting last commit
3. `$ git branch backup`  
   Create a backup branch containing deleted commit
4. `$ git checkout master`  
   Go to the master branch or any branch intended for the commit to be copied to
5. `$ git cherry-pick [commit hash]`  
   Copy the deleted commit to current branch
6. Delete backup branch  
   _Follow steps 10 & 11 from [Common Workflow with Branches](#Common-Workflow-with-Branches))_

<br>
<br>

## Contributing to Open Source Projects

1. Fork the Project repository (from GitHub)
2. `$ git clone [forkedRepository]`  
   Clone the forked version of the project repository
3. `$ git remote add upstream [urlOfOriginalRepository]`  
   Add the original repository as an additional remote alongside the forked repository
4. `Add` and `Commit` changes to the cloned repository
5. `$ git pull upstream master`  
   Pull changes from the original repsository to the local cloned repository
6. `$ git push origin master`  
   Push changes to the master branch of the forked repository
7. Click **Pull Request** button in the forked repository to request changes to be pulled into the original repository

<br>
<br>

## Creating a Private Forked Repository

1. `$ git clone --bare [urlOfOrignalRepository]`  
   Create a temporary clone of the repository
2. Create a private repository (on Github)
3. `cd [directoryOfClonedRepository]`  
   Change directory to previously cloned directory
4. `$ git push --mirror [urlOfPrivateRepository]`  
   Push to newly created private respository using its url
5. `cd ..` `rm -rf [clonedRepository]`  
   Remove the temporary clone
6. `$ git clone [urlOfPrivateRepository]`
   Clone the private repository
7. `$ git remote add upstream [urlOfOriginalRepository]`  
   Set the original repository as a upstream remote to pull any future changes to the private repository  
   _To pull in future changes, use the command `$ git pull upstream [branch]`_
8. `$ git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE`  
   Disable pushing to the original repository  
   _Instead, push to the private repository which has the remote name of "origin" by default by using `$ git push origin [branch]`_

## .gitignore

For excluding files from Version Control

2. Enter the name of any files to be excluded from tracking in `.gitignore`

- `*.html` will ignore all files with html extension
